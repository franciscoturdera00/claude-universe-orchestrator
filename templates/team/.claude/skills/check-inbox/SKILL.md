# /check-inbox — Read new Lilo messages

Scan `.lilo-inbox/` for unread messages from Lilo, read them in order, then archive so they are not re-processed.

## What this skill does (and does not)

**Does:** discover new files, read them, summarize each one inline so the operator (or the reviewing human) sees what arrived, archive to `.lilo-inbox/processed/`.

**Does not:** act on the instructions. After summarizing, decide what to do with the contents using your own judgment as the PM/operator. If a message requests work, incorporate it into your plan; if it's a nudge, acknowledge and continue; if it's ambiguous, write a `question` outbox message back to Lilo.

## Steps

1. List `.lilo-inbox/*.md` (and `*.json` if any), **excluding** `.lilo-inbox/processed/`.
   ```bash
   find .lilo-inbox -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.json' \) | sort
   ```
2. If the list is empty, say `Inbox empty.` and stop.
3. For each file in timestamp order:
   - Read the full file
   - Print a one-line summary: `<filename>: <first meaningful line or title>`
   - If the message is long, also print a 2-3 bullet summary of the ask
4. After reading every file, create `.lilo-inbox/processed/` if needed and move all read files into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .lilo-inbox/processed
   mv .lilo-inbox/<file1> .lilo-inbox/<file2> ... .lilo-inbox/processed/
   ```
5. State `Inbox cleared. N message(s) processed.` and then — **outside the skill** — decide how to act on the content.

## When to run

- **On session start** (first thing after reading `.team-state.json` if in team mode).
- **When Lilo nudges you** via `tmux send-keys` — any message saying "check your inbox" or similar.
- **After long operations** that may have spanned several minutes — Lilo may have queued something while you were busy.
- **Never on a loop.** The inbox is async but not high-frequency. Polling it wastes tokens. Rely on explicit nudges and session-start checks.

## Notes

- The `processed/` archive is permanent — do not delete it. It's the audit trail of everything Lilo has asked you to do.
- If you find a message you already handled (duplicate from a re-nudge), still archive it; better to be idempotent than to leave stale files in the inbox.
- Messages are authored by Lilo on behalf of the operator. Treat them as you would direct instructions from the user.
